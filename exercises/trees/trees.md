* Write a function build_tree_lst() that uses textbook implementation of a tree as a **list of lists** and returns a tree that looks like the one in the attached image.

* Write a function build_tree_oop() that uses textbook implementation of a tree as **nodes and references** and returns a tree that looks like the one in the attached image.

* Write function *height*, member of the class BinaryTree, that returns the height of a tree.

* Implement a binary heap as a max heap, rather than a min heap.

* Create a max heap with a limited size. In other words, the heap only keeps track of *n* largest items. If the heap grows in size to its limit, the smallest item is dropped (removed from a heap). If a new item is smaller than the smallest heap item, the new element is not added.
