# Sort of

Complete the following exercises and submit your source code to KATIE as a single file (archive).

1. Sort list `[20, 16, 12, 14, 14, 15, 17, 17, 7, 13]` using either Insertion or Selection sorting algorithm. Show every step of the process.

2. Sort list `[20, 16, 12, 14, 14, 15, 17, 17, 7, 13]` using either MergeSort, QuickSort, or HeapSort algorithm. Show every step of the process.

The provided output file contains [ANSI color codes](https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting). These codes are supposed to change the view of the console output and your text editor is unlikely to support them. Use `cat` (linux/Mac) or type (Windows) to see output in colors.
