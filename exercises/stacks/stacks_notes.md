# What are Stacks and Queues

* Linear Data Structure
* Flexible Size (Add sizes and remove elements)
* Stacks are LIFO (Last in First Out)
* Queues are FIFO (First in first Out)

## Lists vs. Arrays

* Array is a group of data
* It is a static data structure, cannot grow after it is instantiated
* List starts off as a static array but it has a bit more room where we can add more values
* __It can grow__
* Programs with a lot of data can take a lot of time to process all the data

## Stacks

* Recursive function (if there is a function which keeps calling itself)
* You can only add data and retrieve data from one end
* Pushed in and popped out from the same end

[Procedural Implementation of Stacks](stacks_proc.py)

## Differences between Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming

* The role of a function in procedural programming is to take steps in the data
* Object oriented programming allows for ways to add functions to find implementations that you did not think before
