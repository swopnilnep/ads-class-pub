# Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon

Complete the following programming project and submit your source code (as a single archive file) to KATIE.

## Problem
You may have seen the commercial in which **Kevin Bacon** attempts to cash a check without ID.

In this commercial Bacon collects an unlikely combination of people with increasingly tenuous relationships that somehow wind up connecting him with the owner of the store. So you see, he says, "we are practically brothers!" This idea caught on in Hollywood and if youâ€™ve acted in a movie, your *Kevin Bacon number* is a reflection of how many links away from **Kevin Bacon** you are.

One actor is linked to another if they have acted in the same movie. For example, **Simon Helberg** of the *Big Bang Theory* acted with **Gillian Jacobs** in *Let it Go*, in 2011. **Gillian Jacobs** acted with **John Malkovich** in *Gardens of the Night* in 2008. **John Malkovich** acted with **Kevin Bacon** in *Queens Logic* in 1991. The idea is nicely described here: [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon).

## Task

Your job is to write a program that allows the user to enter the name of an actor and then determines the *Kevin Bacon number* for that actor. The program should print out the *Kevin Bacon number* for the actor and both the list of actors that form the chain and the movies they acted in together.

There is one data file for this assignment: movie_actors.csv. The format of the file is as follows:

```
Apokommata (2010)|Leonardo Sfontouris
Apokommata (2010)|Dimitra Kokkori
Apokommata (2010)|Marianna Pouloutiadou
Apokommata (2010)|Dimitra Kokkori
Apokommata (2010)|Anna Etiaridou
Apokrif: Muzyka dlya Petra i Pavla (2005)|Anton Mlodik
Apollo 13 (1995)|Bill Paxton
Apollo 13 (1995)|Gary Sinise
Apollo 13 (1995)|Ed Harris
Apollo 13 (1995)|Tom Hanks
Apollo 13 (1995)|Kevin Bacon
```

## Approach

There are three smaller problems to solve for this assignment. 

1. Build a graph that represents the links between all the actors. To build the graph you should use the `Graph` and `Vertex` classes found in the *pythonds3* package. These classes are implemented just like the code in the textbook. **This is the most challenging part of the assignment**. You should start with a small part of the movies_actors file OR create your own test file. You DO NOT want to start with the full *movie_actors.csv* file as it contains more than 600,000 lines. With your test file use the Python environment to poke around at the graph and make sure that the links are correct. You will also need to devise a way to keep track of the movie that each actor has in common with her neighbors. See the attached kevinbacon.png example graph you might convert into a file and use for testing.

2. Use the *Breadth First Search* algorithm to create the links from all actors back to **Kevin Bacon**.

3. Write a loop that allows the user to enter a name and see the *Kevin Bacon number* plus links. You will need to implement the `traverse` function as described in the book to work backward from the actor entered to **Kevin Bacon**.

Here is an example of the Kevin Bacon program in action. Your program should produce output that is similar (but not necessarily identical).

```
> python kevinbacon.py
What Actor would you like to trace? (exit to quit) Johnny Galecki
The Kevin Bacon Number for  Johnny Galecki  is  3
Johnny Galecki acted with Rachael Leigh Cook in Bookies (2003)
Rachael Leigh Cook acted with Luke Wilson in Blonde Ambition (2007)
Luke Wilson acted with Kevin Bacon in My Dog Skip (2000)
```

## Grading

1. `Vertex` and `Graph` classes are used properly
2. User input is processed (keep asking until 'exit' is entered)
3. Graph is built properly
4. Graph is searched properly
5. Graph traversal works properly
